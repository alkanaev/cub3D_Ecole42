### Cub3D

**This project is inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D that is considered to be the first FPS.**<br>
The idea is to create our own graphic motor using raycasting. Raycasting is one of the rendering methods in computer graphics,
in which the scene is built on the basis of measurements of ray intersections with the rendered surface (so that it's capable
of creating a three-dimensional perspective from a two-dimensional map).
According to the requirements of Cub3D, I used minilibx as a graphic library.
